    "In January, when the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, hit the United States, socioeconomic inequalities were exacerbated. Government mandates were put in place that catered to the majority and left populations unable to social distance or work from home in a vulnerable position. These Americans are dying at higher rates and struggling to find access to healthcare. Testing is behind in the entire U.S., however, even further in zip codes of low income (Coronavirus News: U.S. Poor Hit By Virus Impact – Bloomberg, 2020). People with higher education degrees are more likely to be able to work from home (American Time Use Survey Summary, 2019). When asked by the American Community Census 40% of Americans said they cannot cover a $400 emergency expense; and many of that 40% being families with a small safety net living pay check to pay check (American Community Census, Bahney). \n",

    "Low socioeconomic populations already face countless problems and, unfortunately, adding the severity of today’s pandemic is only intensifying those problems. If we ever want to see change in our society it is important to bring attention to the problems of inequality, we are facing today. Mayor Bill de Blasio even tweeted, __“It’s can’t be said enough: COVID-19 has forced us to confront some deadly disparities and we must address them ALL.”__ The motivation behind this project is to address these disparities through an educational platform. This project will explore visualizations showing the economic profiles of communities at the highest risk for COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to explore how COVID-19 has affected communities of different socioeconomic status. "
